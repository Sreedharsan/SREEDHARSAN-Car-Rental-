          <h1 class="card-title">Tesla Model 3</h1>
          <p class="card-text">Safety is the most important part of the overall Model 3 design. The metal structure is a combination of aluminum and steel, for maximum strength in every area. In a roof-crush test, Model 3 resisted four times its own mass, even with an all-glass roof: that's the same weight as two full-grown African elephants. Model 3 comes with the option of dual motor all-wheel drive, 20” Überturbine Wheels and Performance Brakes and lowered suspension for total control, in all weather conditions. And a carbon fiber spoiler improves stability at high speeds, all allowing Model 3 to accelerate from 0-60 mph* in as little as 3.1 seconds.</p>
